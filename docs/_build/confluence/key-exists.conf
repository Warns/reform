When you use the key&#45;gen task it will generate new keys for you.  Before you do this you may want to do a quick check to see if the key you are about to crate already exists.

{warning}Do not use key&#45;gen or key&#45;exists to rotate your keys.  You will loose the ability to decrypt your current keys.  Instead use the rotate&#45;key tasks.  It will archive your current key and re&#45;encrypt all of your secrets.{warning}
